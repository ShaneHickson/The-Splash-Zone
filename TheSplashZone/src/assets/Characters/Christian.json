    "UltimateD": "For 10 seconds, you gain greatly increased movement speed when not firing. You can lunge forward to close distance and repeatedly bongo-slap your stomach, creating a shockwave that stuns and knocks back enemies in a small radius. Each slam also provides a light heal to nearby allies. Moderate cooldown between slams prevents spamming."
